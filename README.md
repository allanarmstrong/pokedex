# Pokédex

**This is still a WIP**

A Pokédex I built so I can learn how [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) works.

## Built With

- [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co)
- React
- @reach/router

## Getting Started

1. Development files are found in `src/`
2. Entry point is `src/html/index.html`

### Commands

`yarn develop` - Starts a dev server on `localhost:1234`

`yarn build` creates a production build output in `dist/`

`yarn serve` starts a static file server of the dist folder on `localhost:5000`
